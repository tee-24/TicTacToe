# Testing
Testing was ongoing throughout the entire build. As this game runs on a mock terminal, it will not work on mobile devices so no accessibility or responsitivity testing was required.

### Code Institute Python Linter
Validation was done using [CI Python Linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/)
